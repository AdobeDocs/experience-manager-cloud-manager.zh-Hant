# Access Rights Granted {#access-rights-granted}

## User Identity Types {#user-identity-types}

As part of the on-boarding process, Adobe will create an **Organization** identifier for your company in the Adobe Identity Management System (IMS), where all your users and their permissions can be managed. Each user, who needs to be a member of this organization, and will be granted access to any of the [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] services, will need to have their own **Adobe ID**.

To get started with an Adobe ID, please visit [Manage Adobe Identity Types](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/identity.html) for detailed instructions on how to obtain an Adobe ID using one of the identity types available.

### Users and Roles {#users-and-roles}

一旦Adobe建立公司組織後，您的指定管理員將會新增為此組織的第一名成員。The administrator will be granted the administrator permissions by default, and assigned the [!UICONTROL AEM Managed Services] P **roduct**, and one or more [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager] **Product Profiles**. Please visit [Add Users and Roles](setting-up-users-and-roles.md) to learn more about how to configure and manage your team users using the Admin Console.

With these rights granted, your administrator is now set up with a single sign-on (using Adobe ID) to access the [!UICONTROL Experience Cloud] services, login to your AEM cloud environments, and use [!UICONTROL Cloud Manager].
